Executive Summary

Lipa City is classified as a first-class city that is located in Batangas. As the city continues to prosper and grow as the time passes, the continuous growth of the city develops various issues such as the traffic flow which has evidently been a major problem that the citizens of Lipa have been experiencing for a long time. This is contributed by the over-reliance of personal vehicles by the people, which creates a demand for greater road capacity. Due to this, It contributes to a high demand of greater road capacity that leads to congestion making traffic flow slower than usual. Currently, passengers rely solely on guesswork or word-of-mouth for jeepney arrivals, often leading to overcrowding at stops and inefficient trip planning. Jeepney operators also struggle with route monitoring and traffic coordination, resulting in inefficiencies and income loss.

The project intends to address these issues by developing JeepneyGo, a real-time transportation system that improves the commuting and driving experience by  minimizing delays, reducing travel related stress, and enhancing safety.


Project Purpose / Justification

The JeepneyGo project is being launched to address the critical problem of inefficiency and unpredictability within Lipa City's public jeepney system, which causes long wait times for commuters and operational challenges for jeepney drivers. Our primary goal is to modernize this essential service by developing and implementing a real-time mobile application for passenger information and real-time jeepney tracking. This directly supports Lipa City's organizational objective of becoming a "smart city" by introducing modern technology into its public transportation infrastructure. The key benefits will include  a more reliable and stress-free commute experience for the commuters, improved route efficiency and coordination for jeepney drivers, and an overall reduction in traffic congestion, creating a more sustainable and accessible urban environment for all stakeholders.

Business Need / Case

Public transportation in Lipa City remains heavily dependent on jeepneys, yet many of the commuters still face a number of challenges in their transportation experiences This project is set to prevent further uncertainty of jeepney arrival times, causing long waiting periods, traffic congestion due to inefficient route coordination, and a limited use of technology in the public utility sector, leaving commuters without reliable updates. A mobile-based system such as JeepneyGo directly addresses these problems by introducing a digital solution for transparency, efficiency, and commuter satisfaction, ultimately aligning with the city’s growing demand for smarter and more sustainable transport services.

Constraints

Hardware Limitations: Depends on mobile devices with GPS and stable internet connections. Inconsistent GPS signals or poor network coverage in some areas of Lipa City may affect real-time tracking accuracy.

Operational Limitations: Initially only operate only during normal commuting hours (e.g., 5 AM to 10 PM) unless future updates extend this range.

Training Requirements: Some drivers or operators may not be familiar with smartphones or apps, requiring basic digital literacy training for effective “JeepneyGo: Real-Time Transporting System.” adoption.

Third-party Dependency Risks: Heavy reliance on third-party services (Google Maps, Firebase) introduces a risk if these services change terms, become unavailable, or increase pricing.

Emergency Situations: In emergencies (network outages, device malfunctions, etc.), fallback protocols must be considered, such as manual driver reporting via SMS.

Assumptions

Stable Internet Connectivity: It is assumed that commuters, drivers, and the embedded GPS tracker will have access to stable mobile data or wi-fi for real time location updates and communication.

Availability of GPS Signal: The JeepneyGo: Real-Time Transport Monitoring System assumes that GPS signals are reliably available in most parts of Lipa city.
User WIllingness and Participation: The system’s success assumes cooperation from jeepney drivers to install GPS trackers and keep them active during operation.
